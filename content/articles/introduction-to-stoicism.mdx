# Introduction to Stoicism

Stoicism is a practical philosophy that emphasizes personal ethics, rational thinking, and living in harmony with nature. Founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE, it has influenced countless individuals throughout history and continues to resonate with people today.

## Core Principles

1. **Virtue is the Only Good**: The Stoics believed that living a life of virtue - wisdom, justice, courage, and self-control - is the path to happiness.

2. **Focus on What You Can Control**: We should focus our energy on things within our control and accept what isn't.

3. **Live According to Nature**: This means understanding our role in the larger universe and acting in accordance with reason.

## Modern Applications

Today, Stoicism offers valuable tools for:
- Managing stress and anxiety
- Building resilience
- Making better decisions
- Maintaining perspective in difficult situations

Remember, Stoicism isn't about suppressing emotions - it's about understanding them and responding wisely rather than reacting impulsively.
