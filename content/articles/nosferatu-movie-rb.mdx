Robert Eggers' reimagining of the classic vampire tale "Nosferatu" brings a fresh perspective to F.W. Murnau's 1922 masterpiece. The film showcases Eggers' distinctive cinematographic style, blending period authenticity with modern filmmaking techniques.

The visual composition draws heavily from German Expressionism, much like its predecessor, while incorporating Eggers' signature attention to historical detail and atmospheric lighting. The film's cinematography creates a palpable sense of dread and supernatural presence, perfectly capturing the essence of the vampire myth.
