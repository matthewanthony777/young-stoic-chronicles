Unlock time travel with this Python-based simulation! üï∞‚è≥ü™êüí´
Imagine capturing a moment on video and then watching it unfold in reverse, as if you‚Äôre peering into a world where time flows backward. 
Inspired by the concepts of Christopher Nolan‚Äôs "Tenet," this project helps you to explore the magic of temporal inversion in a way that's both playful and profound. 


## Features 

- **Temporal Inversion**: Transform your footage into mind-bending reversed sequences, just like in Tenet.‚åö 
- **Live Action Capture**: Watch your recording unfold with a sleek status display that keeps you in the loop.üì∏  
- **Smart Storage**: Your temporal experiments are automatically organised with precise timestamps.
- **Bulletproof Design**: Robust error handling keeps your project running smooth and crash-free.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies 

- **Python**: The programming language driving this project's temporal magic.
- **OpenCV**: Captures video from the camera and manipulates our video streams.
- **NumPy**: Provides support for handling mathematical operations on video frames.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and install the
dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Alternatively, if you are starting from scratch and using macOS, you can install Python and its dependencies through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python3
```

## The Code:

Lets jump into our Tenet turnstile! Our streamlined code lets you instantly time-travel, without the lengthy tutorials.
Just install, run and watch as your computer becomes a time machine. 
The code below includes descriptions and explanations for each component and function, making it easy to understand.

## Conclusion

And so, like the film that inspired it, our Tenet time-travel simulator stands as a testament to the fascinating interplay between time, technology, and human ingenuity. 
Whether you're a film enthusiast, a Python developer, Physicist or simply someone intrigued by the concept of temporal inversion, 
This project offers a unique window into the possibilities that emerge when we dare to think differently about time itself.
Remember: What's happened, happened. But with this recorder, you can always watch it happen again - backwards.
